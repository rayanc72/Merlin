A Python code for plotting and analyzing temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) data.

The code reads dataset in (.txt) format exported from the PL instruments made by FLS. OR dataset can be provided in (.dat) format where the first column is 
wavelength (nm) and the subsequent columns are PL counts at different temperatures. A list of temperature needs to be provided when prompted.
